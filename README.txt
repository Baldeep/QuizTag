			      Interactive Museum Exhibits

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This app aims to make musuem visits more interactive in order to be more appealing to 
younger audiences, particularly the 10-15 age range.

The application will involve a quiz, which will lead the user through a "treasure hunt" 
in which the user will have to find specific museum exhibits to answer question by 
connecting to NFC tags hidden behind/inside the information tag.
